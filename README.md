# Data Scientist Nanodegree
## Data Science Blog Post :- Indian Startup FundingÂ Insight

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)


You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

We recommend students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

### Code

Template code is provided in the `finding_donors.ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use the included `visuals.py` Python file and the `census.csv` dataset file to complete your work. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project. Note that the code included in `visuals.py` is meant to be used out-of-the-box and not intended for students to manipulate. If you are interested in how the visualizations are created in the notebook, please feel free to explore this Python file.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `finding_donors/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook finding_donors.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook finding_donors.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Content
This dataset has funding information of the Indian startups from January 2015 to August 2017. It includes columns with the date funded, the city the startup is based out of, the names of the funders, and the amount invested (in USD).

### Inspiration
- Possible questions which could be answered are:
- How does the funding ecosystem change with time?
- Do cities play a major role in funding?
- Which industries are favored by investors for funding?
- Who are the important investors in the Indian Ecosystem?
- How much funds does startups generally get in India?
